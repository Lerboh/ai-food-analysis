## Next Safe Step

**Step 2: Add Files to Git Staging Area**

Run this command to add all files:
```bash
git add .
```

Or add specific files/folders:
```bash
git add <filename>
```

This will:
- Stage files for the first commit
- **Will NOT modify your files**
- **Will NOT commit anything automatically**
- Prepare files to be included in your first commit

After adding files, you'll be ready to create your first commit.

## Notes

- ✅ Git is installed and working correctly
- ✅ Git repository successfully initialized
- ✅ `.git` folder verified to exist
- ✅ No files were modified during initialization
- ⚠️ All files are currently untracked (need to be added before committing)
